 In the heart of Louisville, KY, the Louisville Police Department and Correctional Services Complex
 is the regional headquarters of Knox Country law enforcement. Connected directly to the County
 Courthouse via skybridge, and to two other buildings, it is one of the largest non-commercial
 buildings in the region. Unfortunately, like the St. Peregrin Hospital, it is also overrun
 by the Knox Infection and is host to a great many former law enforcement officers, who are
 now serving and protecting their undead companions.

 Still, the Police Department's generously-sized armory is a potential treasure-trove of arms and 
 armour if one can cut through the hordes and the secure gates, perhaps rivalled only by the 
 Stars & Stripes Gun Store in The Grand Ohio Mall both in terms of potential loot and the number 
 of undead surrounding it.
